 Weather Data Analysis with Python
 -This is my first data analysis project using Python, focused on exploring and understanding weather patterns.
 -The project includes:
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing of weather datasets
  - Detection of outliers to identify unusual weather conditions
  - Visualization of temperature, pressure, and humidity trends
  - Forecasting future weather using regression and predictive modeling
- Tools used: 
 - Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn

# [Project2; FAKESTORE DATA ANALYSIS] (https://github.com/johnmayogi-svg/mmjportifolio/blob/main/Fakestore_Analysis.ipynb))
FakeStore Data Analysis and Price Prediction Project
- This project focuses on performing end-to-end data analysis using data extracted from the FakeStore API
 - The main objectives of the project include:
 - Data Extraction & Web Scraping: Collecting e-commerce product data using Pythonâ€™s requests and BeautifulSoup libraries.
 - Data Cleaning & Preparation: Handling missing values, formatting prices, and categorizing product information.
 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing trends in pricing, product categories, and customer ratings using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
 - Machine Learning Prediction: Building and evaluating a model to predict product prices based on product features such as category, rating, and description.
 - Data Storage: Saving processed data to a CSV file for further use and reproducibility.
-Tools used: 
Python, Pandas, NumPy, BeautifulSoup, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
